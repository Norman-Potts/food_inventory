# food_inventory 

A food inventory system to track food purchases after shopping. 
This project will implement the new web techologies I have used. These include:

* MongoDB
* GraphQL 
* NodeJS with Express
* Axios 
* Apollo 
* ReactJS with Redux <---! Can't use react with Apollo. Will only use Apollo Client. 
* Bootstrap v5
* Html

Note: No style sheets of my own, just using Bootstrap. I am doing this because 
often I get lost in developing my own CSS, and I fail to properly implement the
libary as I tend to prefer to use my own CSS.  

This version will be simplistic to show case the basics of the above technologies. 
Later features can be added after project has been setup. 
The Inventory will be presented as a chart 8 wide and as much as needed tall to form a scrolling list. 
Inventory will be sortable and later searchable.
Items will be presented with text name classifications, later  represented with images and icons to represent the class name.

Item will have due dates, UPC if needed, weight, count of items.
